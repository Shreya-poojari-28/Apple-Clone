# Apple-Website
Project Summary: This project is a static, responsive website designed using only HTML and CSS, aimed at replicating the design and layout of an Apple product page. The website showcases a clean, modern design, inspired by the look and feel of the official Apple website, with a focus on displaying various Apple products such as iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads. While it does not include any interactive functionality or backend processing, the site is built to be fully responsive, ensuring it looks great and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizesâ€”from mobile devices to desktops. The project demonstrates proficiency in front-end web design and responsive layout techniques using HTML and CSS, providing a solid foundation for further development, including adding JavaScript or backend features for full interactivity and functionality.
